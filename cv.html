  <h1>Kind of Motivation letter</h1>
  <p> <b>In pursuit</b> of a quality education, in the 7th grade I entered the <strong>Nazarbayev Intellectual School</strong> and in the same class met my <em>favorite teacher</em>, a teacher of computer science. This is the same <mark>person who unleashed</mark> in me the enthusiasm for learning computer science and programming languages. Starting from the <small>9th grade</small>, I began to participate in competitions in robotics at city, regional, republican and even international levels, won prizes, presented design work. Since ICT was given to me with <del>ease</del>, I decided to enter a specialty in the same area. The best option for me was the newly opened university, located at the epicenter of the AITU IT infrastructure. I am currently in my first year in Cybersecurity. From early childhood I was interested in computers. When I visited relatives at home who have him, then I could not be torn away from him at all. At first, I played old games like Snowballs and Solitaire on them. With the same zeal, I <sub>explored</sub> other computer capabilities available to the <sup>user</sup>. The adventures in the world of computing technology did not end there. When I was 7 years old, my parents bought a computer for the house. Seeing with what interest I was sitting behind him, dad casually said that I would become a great programmer and laughed. After a while, my mother gave me a book about the basics of working at a computer and its functionality, which I read very quickly, while simultaneously applying theory in practice. Around the same time, I learned that all <ins>software is made by people in Java</ins>, and interest in this area has become more and more every time. Concluding all of the above, I want to say that the attraction to something curbed in childhood shows what a person really wants to do in the future. I am confident in my choice. </p>
